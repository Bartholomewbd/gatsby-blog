Hello! :wave: So I decided with a fresh start for a month, I want to try to put out one piece of content every day and see how long this streak can go.  So when I woke up this morning to plan out today's content I quickly bit off more than I could chew and became very overwhelmed. So I decided to break my idea down into smaller pieces and even then realized that the intial setup for my original idea was too large to do in the little bit of time I had today between work and everything else. Going over this with a friend I came to the realization this is a common problem when learning or working in the field of development.  So I came up with a plan to spread the goal blog post over a couple of days and give myself a couple of days to do the initial setup. That brings us to today's blog post. It is very important to break down your tasks into manageable chunks for a couple of reasons. It allows you to properly time box them and allows you to pivot if need be. However, this is especially difficult if you are on a time crunch for a specific thing. Thankfully this is just a self exploration so it was easy for me to pivot to this article and give myself extra time to set up the other post I wanted to do.

The need to break down a problem is obvious but the difficulty that comes with it is often surprising especially for people new to coding.  But once you master this skill, the same can be done for any problem you are facing, whether it is writing a blog post or solving that coding problem for the first time. So I decided to come up with some actionable steps to break down your coding problem into some crude actionable steps.

* Don't Let the blank page freak you out -
One of the biggest problems new coders face is starting from scratch.  It is very important to not let this stop you from getting started and to remember YOU GOT THIS! :thumbsup: 

* Start with what you know -
You need to start with what you are given as inputs and what your end outputs are going to be. You can then start to plan out your functions and modules around these inputs and the end goals.  

* Break down the steps in plain english -
Initially a lot of people take a problem and dive right into the code and this is a big mistake. It is very hard to solve a problem if you don't understand what you are trying to accomplish.  The best way to be sure you understand the problem is to break the steps down in plain english usually as comments in your code.  This accomplishes two things, it allows you to make sure you have a plan to follow and if it comes down to you needing help it will be easier to reach out to someone with a question in plain english than with code. 

* Review and Iterate on your steps -
After your initial plan is completed you can then go back over the steps and continue to break them down if they need to be while continuing to focus on the steps required in plain english not the syntax required. Small tasks are your friend.  It allows you to solve small problems in code and keep your code clean and modular.

* Turn your steps into code -
Going through your steps one at a time, turn them into the code.  The beauty of having small steps written in plain english is that if you get stuck you can then search google or duck duck go for the code you need or ask a colleague or mentor in plain english. Don't be afraid to refactor as you go.  As you progress through the steps you may come across a dependency or use case that wasn't clear in the initial planning. 

* Enjoy your success -
:boom: YOU DID IT.  It is super important to reflect on what you accomplished especially if you are learning to code. When you are learning it is important to celebrate every success no matter how big or small because this will keep you motivated!

It is also very important to realize that you should use all the tools at your disposal.  I cannot tell you how many times I have asked someone that is trying to figure it out what did you search for on Google and the response is, Oh we are allowed to do that? Of course you are!  As you get deeper into the career you will start to learn the more senior you get the better you get at searching for the answers you need.
